A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/jkantner/pen/KQPdXK.

 A remake of an [older demo](https://codepen.io/jkantner/details/xOxxXV/), which is a [Codrops-inspired](https://tympanus.net/Development/IsometricGrids/index.html) scrollable grid component. This time, I used CSS grid to organize the cards, a vanilla CSS variable to control the scrolling, and much less JavaScript.

Due to use of some modern CSS techniques, this demo won’t work properly in IE. Scrolling in Safari is jumpy, don’t know why.
